# rectangle5-10

5-10.    a.    Modify the rectangle class from 5-8b (shown above and attached) so rectangles
can be added or subtracted by overloading the + and - operators to mean adding the length and 
width of both rectangles or subtracting the lengths and widths of the second rectangle 
from the first rectangle.
b.    Modify the rectangle class again so rectangles can be compared by overloading 
the comparison operators (==, !=, <, >) to compare the area of the two rectangles.

Use the following ex5-10.cpp and create the corresponding rectangle5-10.h header file.
Attach and submit the rectangle5-10.h with both parts a and b and the output .txt file.
